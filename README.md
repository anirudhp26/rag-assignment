# RAG Assignment

This project demonstrates the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using `sentence_transformers` and `weaviate`.

## Overview

RAG is a technique that combines retrieval-based and generation-based methods to improve the quality of generated text. This project leverages `sentence_transformers` for embedding generation and `weaviate` for efficient vector search.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `sentence_transformers`
- `weaviate-client`
